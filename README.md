Installing Turbo Assembler (TASM), Turbo Debugger (TD) on Ubuntu
Step 1
First we will install an windows emulator called dosbox.
sudo apt-get install dosbox
Step2
Download the packages for Turbo Assembler(tasm) Turbo Debugger(td). Create a directory for tasm in your home directory and extract files into that directory.If you are unable to extract type this in your terminal and try again
sudo apt-get install unrar
Step3
download this sample .asm file. Place the file in the tasm directory.

NOTE:  You can use your own asm file instead
Step4
Open dosbox( generally found in games sublist ). Now you have to mount the virtual c drive.
mount c /home/<username> eg: /home/alse


Step5
Now go to your TASM directory




Now test the test3.asm which you downloaded
